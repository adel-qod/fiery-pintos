My work to complete a pintos project

Pintos is a skelton Operating System built at Stanford and used by OS students
to build a more complete operating systems by completing some major components
(tasks include work on scheduling, drivers(minor), virtual memory, file
systems, and user program loading)

This is my work to complete all of the projects found at Stanford plus adding
comments and documentation to explain all the other parts that are not covered
and I deem important (such as bootloading)
